Now all these classes have a suffix *Simple* \n(as already defined for some previous classes such as `PeProvisionerSimple` and `VmAllocationPolicySimple`). \nFor instance, to instantiate a `Cloudlet` you have to execute a code such as:\n\n ```java\nCloudletSimple cloudlet = new CloudletSimple(required, parameters, here);\n```   \n\nHowever, since these interfaces were introduced in order to also enable the creation of different cloudlet classes, \nthe recommendation is to declare your object using the interface, not the class: \n \n ```java\nCloudlet cloudlet = new CloudletSimple(required, parameters, here);\n```   \n\nThe method `setBrokerId(int userId)` from `Vm` and `Cloudlet` were refactored to `setBroker(DatacenterBroker broker)`,\nnow requiring a `DatacenterBroker` instead of just an int ID which may be even nonexistent.\n\nYou don't need to explicitly create a `DatacenterCharacteristics` anymore. Such object is created internally when a `Datacenter` is created.\nA `VmAllocationPolicy` doesn't require any parameter at all. A `Datacenter` doesn't require a name, storage list and scheduling interval too.\nThe name will be automatically defined.

That is different from the same method in `VmUtilizationHistory` since the former just works during simulation execution, while the latter uses the history to compute the utilization.\r\n- `Vm.getHostRamUtilization()` and `Vm.getHostBwUtilization()` provide the same feature for RAM and BW.\r\n- Adds the `VmRelativeHostResourceUtilizationExample` to show the relative percentage of each resource every VM is using from its Host.\r\n- Introduces `getUpTimeHours()` and `getTotalUpTimeHours()` methods in `Host` interface to return the number of hours a Host has been active.\r\n\r\nRenames following methods in `Host` and `Vm` to provide uniformity:\r\n\r\n- `Host.getUtilizationOfCpu` to `getCpuPercentUtilization`\r\n- `Host.getUtilizationOfCpuMips` to `getCpuMipsUtilization`\r\n- `Host.getUtilizationOfBw` to `getBwUtilization`\r\n- `Host.getUtilizationOfRam` to `getRamUtilization`\r\n- `Vm.getCpuPercentUsage` to `getCpuPercentUtilization`\r\n- `Vm.getTotalCpuMipsUsage` to `getTotalCpuMipsUtilization`\r\n\r\n## 3. Refactor and redesign classes in distributions package (#201)\r\n    \r\n- Provides uniformity for parameter order in `ContinuousDistribution` classes\r\n- Introduces new constructors for `ContinuousDistribution` classes, enabling the researcher to provide a specific `RandomGenerator` instance that will be used as the actual pseudo random number generator.\r\n- Makes the `ContinuousDistribution` classes to use inheritance instead of composition. Despite the recommendation is to favor composition, in this case, that was just causing a huge increase in memory usage in large scale simulations. This way, now `ContinuousDistribution` classes extend `AbstractRealDistribution` instead of storing an attribute of this type.\r\n\r\n## 4. General Features \r\n\r\n- Moves time-related methods from Conversion to TimeUtil class.\r\n- Introduces `VmAllocationPolicyWorstFit`, `VmAllocationPolicyRandom`, `VmAllocationPolicyRoundRobin`.\r\n- Moves `ExperimentRunner` and `Experiment` classes to main module, to enable researchers extend such classes to implement their own experiments that execute in a repeatable manner. This way, they can use a scientific approach to collect valid results. Moving this base classes to the main module stops researchers from depending on the `cloudsim-plus-testbeds` module, which just provides existing testbeds that may be used just as a learning resource.\r\n- Smaller bug-fixes.\r\n\r\n## 5. Performance \r\n\r\nThe performance improvements in this release are impressive. The list below shows where the improvements were made. If you want a glympse of the impact in simulation time, check the end of the [Exclusive Features section](https://github.com/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus#main-exclusive-features) at the home page.\r\n\r\n- Improves performance of Broker's Cloudlets creation request (#203)\r\n- The `Host` previous utilization mips is just used when there is a `DatacenterPowerSupply` instance attached to the `Datacenter`. Since getting the utilization of CPU is a very expensive operation in large scale experiments, if a Datacenter power supply is not set, the value is not stored.\r\n- Improves performance of idle VM detection (#200).\r\n- Improves overall performance of VmAllocationPolicies (#190, #191).\r\n- Improves `DatacenterBroker` performance for allocation of VMs and Cloudlets (#109, #188).\r\n- Improves `DatacenterBroker` performance for checking if a VM is alive (#187).\r\n\r\n### 5.1 `UtilizationModelStochastic`\r\n\r\n- Improves performance when getting the utilization value from the history map (#194).\r\n- Introduces `historyEnabled` attribute and `setHistoryEnabled()` to allow enabling or disabling the history of utilization values (#197).\r\n- Enables the utilization history by default, because that option brings more performance (at the cost of higher memory consumption). If you are running a large scale simulation, that history may grow too much, which will impact performance anyway. But for regular simulations, enabling the history provides better performance because a lower number of pseudo-random numbers will be generated.\r\n- Enables the `UtilizationModelStochastic` to always return a new utilization\r\n    * Allow the researcher to decide if a `UtilizationModelStochastic` instance will always return a new utilization value every time the `getUtilization()` methods are called.\r\n    * Returning a new random utilization value for every call to those methods enables the researcher to use a single `UtilizationModelStochastic` instance for all Cloudlets. This drastically reduces simulation time and memory consumption in large scale simulations. It also ensures that distinct Cloudlets may have different resource utilization even for the same requested time.", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/tarball/v5.0.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/zipball/v5.0.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/releases/tag/v5.0.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/releases/18054155", "dateCreated": "2019-06-18T07:31:53Z", "datePublished": "2019-06-18T07:45:07Z"}, {"tag_name": "v4.3.1", "name": "v4.3.1 - Bug fixes, built-in VM power consumption, dynamic activation of hosts and more", "author_name": "manoelcampos", "authorType": "User", "body": "- #185 :: Warn when a simulation which has an explicit termination time is lasting too long.

The parameter order of NormalDistr's constructor was changed from `NormalDistr(long seed, double mean, double standardDeviation)` to `NormalDistr(double mean, double standardDeviation, long seed)`. This way, the `SEED` (when available) is always the last parameter, conforming to constructors of other random number generators such as the UniformDistr. This change probably will cause a compilation error and will be easy to detect and fix. However, if you are using int or long for all the 3 parameters, there will be no error or warning and your simulation results will be just wrong.

To enable collecting such data, it's is required to set a `PowerModel` object by calling `host.getPowerSupply().setPowerModel(powerModel)`. The only difference from previous versions is that the `PowerModel` is defined inside the `PowerSupply` instead of the `Host`.\r\n\r\nThis way, if you don't need power-aware simulations, you need to do nothing because that is the default behaviour.\r\n\r\nThere are some examples such as the [PowerExample](https://github.com/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/blob/master/cloudsim-plus-examples/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples/PowerExample.java) and the [MigrationExample2_PowerUsage](https://github.com/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/blob/master/cloudsim-plus-examples/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples/migration/MigrationExample2_PowerUsage.java).\r\n\r\nMore details are presented below.\r\n\r\n\r\n## VmUtilizationHistory\r\n\r\nAdds the `VmUtilizationHistory` class to store resource utilization history by a given `Vm`. This way, all `Vm` implementations have a `UtilizationHistory` attribute.\r\n\r\n## PowerVm\r\n\r\n`PowerVm` class was removed and its methods were moved to a new VmUtilizationHistory class.\r\nThe Vm now has an attribute `VmUtilizationHistory` that enables collecting CPU utilization data. \r\nThe `VmUtilizationHistory.enabled` is set by default to false. This way, the user have to manually enable the history to start collecting utilization data. It was disabled by default to reduce memory usage.\r\n\r\n## PowerSupply\r\n\r\nAdds the `PowerSupply` interface to concentrate all power consumption data and operations, enabling any `Host` to get such an information. The `PowerSupply` includes the `PowerModel` that was previously inside the `PowerHost` class.\r\n\r\n## PowerHost\r\n\r\n`PowerHost` class removed and its methods merged into Host. A `PowerSupply` interface was introduced to group power consumption data (including a `PowerModel`). This way, any `Host` can extract power consumption data.  It's just required a PowerModel to be set in the `PowerSupply`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## PowerHostUtilizationHistory and HostDynamicWorkloadSimple\r\n\r\n`PowerHostUtilizationHistory` and `HostDynamicWorkloadSimple` class were removed and their code merged into the `HostSimple` class. \r\n\r\nThe Host's `getUtilizationHistory` method gets the CPU utilization history from its VMs. The Host doesn't store any data. The VM utilization history must be enabled to allow getting such data, by calling `vm.getUtilizationHistory().enable()`.\r\n\r\n## VmAllocationPolicy\r\n\r\nRefactors `VmAllocationPolicy` implementations, mainly the `VmAllocationPolicyAbstract` and `VmAllocationPolicySimple`. \r\n\r\nChanged the method `Host findHostForVm(final Vm vm)` to `Optional<Host> findHostForVm(final Vm vm)`, making it return an `Optional` to explicitly indicate that a suitable `Host` may not be found for a given VM.\r\n\r\nThe method was defined as abstract in the `VmAllocationPolicyAbstract` and it's the single one initially required to be implemented by subclasses of `VmAllocationPolicyAbstract`. \r\n\r\nRemoves `PowerVmAllocationPolicySimple` because it was doing nothing that other policies weren't doing. Introduces the `VmAllocationPolicyFirstFit`.\r\n\r\nRenames the package `org.cloudbus.cloudsim.allocationpolicies.power` to `org.cloudbus.cloudsim.allocationpolicies.migration`. Such allocation policies enable VM migration and can be used now for any kind of simulation, not only for power-aware ones. All internal classes and interfaces were renamed, removing the prefix `Power`.\r\n\r\n# NOTICE\r\nCheck [release 2.2.0](https://github.com/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/releases/tag/v2.0.0) for important updates about power-aware simulations.\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/tarball/v2.0.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/zipball/v2.0.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/releases/tag/v2.0.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/releases/10652550", "dateCreated": "2018-04-20T22:19:37Z", "datePublished": "2018-04-20T22:34:41Z"}, {"tag_name": "v1.3.3", "name": "v1.3.3 - Removes Confusing Examples", "author_name": "manoelcampos", "authorType": "User", "body": "## Removes all the examples that were available at package `org.cloudbus.cloudsim.examples.power`\r\n    \r\nThose simulations aren't in fact examples.

The enum values can be `PERCENTAGE` or `ABSOLUTE`, that respectively defines that the Cloudlet resource usage will be in percentage or absolute values. The existing UtilizationModels continue to define the value in percentage,\r\n  as described in their documentation. The `UtilizationModelDynamic` (previously called `UtilizationModelArithmeticProgression`) allows setting a different unit\r\n  for such an `UtilizationModel` ([#62](https://github.com/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/issues/62)).\r\n- `UtilizationModelDynamic` now allows\r\n  defining the resource usage increment behavior using a Lambda Expression, enabling the developer to give a function that performs the increment in an arithmetic, geometric, exponential or any other kind of progression he/she needs ([#64](https://github.com/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/issues/64)). \r\n- Updated the `DatacenterBroker` interface and implementing classes, including the methods `setVmComparator` and `setCloudletComparator` to enable\r\n  a developer to set a `Comparator` object (which can be given as a Lambda Expression) to sort VMs and Cloudlets before they are actually requested to be created in some Datacenter. This enables defining priorities to request the creation of such objects.\r\n  If no `Comparator` is defined, the objects creation request follows the order in which they were submitted.\r\n- [Host Fault Injection Mechanism (under development)](https://github.com/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/blob/master/cloudsim-plus-examples/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples/HostFaultInjectionExample1.java) to enable injection of random failures into Hosts PEs: it injects failures into Host PEs and reallocates working PEs to running   VMs. When all PEs from a Host fail, it starts clones of failed VMs to recovery from failure.  This way, it is simulated the instantiation of VM snapshots into different Hosts ([#81](https://github.com/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/issues/81)).\r\n  - Added the method Host.getWorkingPesList().\r\n  - Poisson Distribution implementation enabling the simulation of inter-arrival times of events such as Host failures.\r\n- Added the method void `submitCloudletList(List<? extends Cloudlet> list, Vm vm)` to the `DatacenterBroker`,  enabling submission of a list of cloudlets to run inside a specific VM.\r\n- Added the method void `submitCloudletList(List<? extends Cloudlet> list, Vm vm, double submissionDelay)` to the `DatacenterBroker`,  enabling submission of a list of cloudlets to run inside a specific VM, and at the same time,  allowing delaying the creation of such cloudlets.\r\n- Added a `getCloudletList()` method int the `CloudletScheduler` to get the list of all cloudlets which are executing or waiting inside a given VM.\r\n- Includes new boolean methods to the Pe interface to make easier to check the PE status.\r\n  New methods are `isFree()`, `isBuzy()`, `isFailed(`) and `isWorking()`.\r\n- Allowed disabling log on every `SimEntity` by calling the new method `SimEntity.setLog()`.\r\n  If `Log.disable(`) is called, it disables all simulation logs,\r\n  independent of the configuration on each entity. \r\n  This new feature enables fine-grained control of entities log.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- Changed the methods `getRam()`, `getBw()` and `getSize()` from Vm interface to instead of returning a long value that represents the resource capacity,\r\n  to return an actual Resource object that provides information about the capacity and usage. The method getSize() was renamed to getStorage().\r\n- Changed the methods `getRamCapacity()`, `getBwCapacity()` and `getStorageCapacity()` from Host interface to instead of returning a long value that represents the resource capacity, to return an actual Resource object that provides information about the capacity and usage. The methods were renamed, removing the \"Capacity\" suffix.\r\n- Automatic generation of IDs for Hosts, VMs and Cloudlets. \r\n    - Hosts IDs can be manually defined using the `setId()` method, but the constructor parameter was removed.\r\n      The IDs of Hosts across different Datacenters can be duplicated, \r\n      since when a search for a Host is made using the HostList method,\r\n      just the Hosts of a given Datacenter are considered.\r\n    - Hosts IDs are generated when a List of Hosts is attached to a Datacenter. \r\n    - Cloudlets and VMs IDs are generated when they are submitted to a Broker.\r\n- Hosts constructors require the RAM and bandwidth capacity, since storage already was required.\r\n- Instantiating a `ResourceProvisionerSimple` now requires just a default no-args constructor.\r\n- The `DatacenterBroker` interfaces now allow using Java 8 Lambda Expressions to define selection policies.\r\n  - It provides a functional way of defining the policies to select a Datacenter to host a Vm, a fallback Datacenter when the creation of requested VMs failed in the previous selected Datacenter and to select a VM to run a Cloudlet.\r\n  - The DatacenterBrokerSimple is yet selecting the first Datacenter to place VMs and uses a round-robin policy to select a VM to run the Cloudlets. If such behaviors need to be changed, it is not required to create a new DatacenterBroker class. \r\n  - Since there are 3 selection policies to override (the selection of default datacenter, fallback datacenter and VM), the combination of different implementations for these 3 policies will require the creation of several DatacenterBroker implementations that will be impossible to maintain.\r\n  - Using the new functional implementation there is no need to create a new DatacenterBroker class and the implementations can be exchanged just using the new `setDatacenterSupplier`, `setFallbackDatacenterSupplier` and `setVmMapper` methods, passing a Lambda Expression to them.\r\n  - Automatically set the DatacenterBroker when Cloudlets and VMS are submitted. ([#83](https://github.com/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/issues/83))\r\n  - Refactored the method `CloudletScheduler.getCloudletFinishedList()` to keep the list of finished Cloudlets after the simulation\r\n    ends. The `DatacenterBroker.getCloudletsFinishedList()` method returns the list of finished Cloudlets, but for all VMs of the broker.\r\n    The `CloudletScheduler` method allows getting the finished list for a specific VM, enabling the researcher to compute some metrics using the data stored in Cloudlets attributes after the simulation ends.

Some [bugs](https://github.com/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug+milestone%3A%22CloudSim+Plus+1.0%22) that reduced the framework accuracy were also fixed. Some of these principles, practices and recommendations are [Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern), [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29) and clean code programming.\r\n\r\nWith all these principles in mind, CloudSim Plus has become a modern, better structured and much easier-to-use  cloud simulation framework. It is a Java 8 framework that strongly relies on the most recent features of Java language to provide a code that is simpler, easier to understand and to extend. There are innumerous changes and several exclusive features and improvements that make CloudSim Plus a promising project.\r\n\r\nSome of the most relevant and exclusive features and improvements are presented below:\r\n- Parallel execution of experiments, enabling multiple runs of a given simulation to be executed simultaneously \r\n  in a multi-core machine.\r\n- Horizontal VM scaling to balance workload of dynamically arrived cloudlets by creating new VMs on-demand.\r\n- Dynamic creation of VMs and Cloudlets by delaying their submission to a broker.\r\n- Dynamic creation of VMs at runtime without requiring the need to create new brokers.\r\n- Listener objects to monitor several events happening during simulation execution, enabling metrics collection and dynamic resource allocation for SLA fulfillment.\r\n- Classes and interfaces to allow implementation of heuristics such as Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing, Ant Colony Systems and so on.\r\n- Implementation of the Completely Fair Scheduler used in recent version of the Linux Kernel, that in fact performs task preemption \r\n  as a multi-task mechanism.\r\n- Completely re-designed, reusable and simpler Network module that just works.\r\n- Extremely simpler constructors for objects such as Datacenter, Host, Vm, Cloudlet, VmAllocationPolicy, VmScheduler and ClodletSchedler.\r\n- A very easier way to initialize a simulation by just calling a no-args constructor of the CloudSim class.\r\n- Totally re-organized package and modules structure, grouping classes such as Hosts into an exclusive package.\r\n\r\nAnd for the first time, a cloud simulation framework is provided at the [Maven Central repository](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.cloudsimplus/cloudsim-plus) to enable a researcher to include CloudSim Plus as a dependency into his/her pom.xml project file, making it even easier to use CloudSim Plus. Such a feature also enables researchers to implement new modules and tools running on top of CloudSim Plus, without requiring them to include CloudSim Plus source code inside their projects. That also encourage these researchers making changes to CloudSim Plus code to submit pull request to include those changes in the official repository, contributing to the entire academic and open source community. \r\n\r\nThe efforts of CloudSim Plus already were recognized by the acceptance of a paper in a top conference. More details will be provided as soon as the paper is published. \r\n\r\nWe'd like to hear from researchers using CloudSim Plus.

That condition can check if the VM is overloaded based on CPU, BW or RAM usage.\r\n\r\nIt also provides a completely redesigned and refactored Network module that just works. The list of included features are as follows:\r\n\r\n## Added\r\n- Introduced a `VmScaling` interface and a `HorizontalVmScalingSimple` class,\r\n  inside the [autoscaling package](https://github.com/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/tree/master/cloudsim-plus/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/autoscaling), that provides a horizontal scaling mechanism for VMs, allowing dynamic creation of VMs according to an overload condition. Such a condition is defined\r\n  by a predicate that can check different VM resources usage such as CPU, RAM or BW.\r\n  See the new [LoadBalancerByVmHorizontalScalingExample](https://github.com/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/tree/master/cloudsim-plus-examples/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples/LoadBalancerByVmHorizontalScalingExample.java) for a usage example.\r\n- Added the methods `addOnClockTickListener` and `removeOnClockTickListener` to `Simulation` interface to allow defining a Listener to be notified every time the simulation clock advances.\r\n- Added methods `addOnClockTickListener()` and `removeOnClockTickListener()` in Simulation interface in order to add\r\n  and remove listeners for the new OnClockTick event, that is fired every time that the simulation clock advances.\r\n- Added `Vm.getTotalUtilizationOfCpu()` to get Vm's CPU utilization percentage for the current simulation time.\r\n- Added `Broker.submitVm` and `Broker.submitCloudlet` to add a single Vm or Cloudlet to a broker.\r\n\r\n## Changed\r\n- Renamed the class `GraphReader` to `TopologyReader`.\r\n- Network module was almost totally refactored and redesigned to provide a module that just works.\r\n  The module was not reusasble at all and it had a huge amount of duplicated code. Some classes\r\n  such as Switch were just an entire copy from each other.\r\n  The packet classes relied on ID to identify the sender and receiver entities and it was\r\n  very difficult to know if a given packet class was storing the ID of a Host, Vm or Cloudlet.\r\n  Now the packets use actual objects such as Host, Vm and Cloudlet to make clear\r\n  what kind of entities are communicating.\r\n- The network examples were just confusing and useless. They have been completely refactored\r\n  and redesigned in order to provide a clear and understandable code that can in fact be reusable.\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/tarball/v0.9-beta.2", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/zipball/v0.9-beta.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/releases/tag/v0.9-beta.2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/releases/5066971", "dateCreated": "2017-01-04T14:26:22Z", "datePublished": "2017-01-04T14:31:42Z"}, {"tag_name": "v0.9-beta.1", "name": "v0.9-beta.1 - A re-designed EventListener mechanism for simulation monitoring, allowing adding multiple Listeners for the same event", "author_name": "manoelcampos", "authorType": "User", "body": "### Added\r\n- Allowed to delay the submission of VMs by a `DatacenterBroker`, simulating the dynamic arrival of VMs (closes the feature request #23)\r\n- Included extremelly helpful package documentation that can be viewed directly on your IDE or online [here](http://cloudsimplus.org/apidocs/).\r\n  Such a package documentation gives a general overview of the classes used to build a cloud simulation.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- Renamed `Simulation` class method `abruptallyTerminate` to `abort`.\r\n- Renamed the class `HostPacket` to `VmPacket` because such a kind of packet is sent between VMs.\r\n- Renamed the class `NetworkPacket` to `HostPacket` because such a kind of packet is sent between Hosts.\r\n- Renamed the class `InfoPacket` to `IcmpPacket` because such a kind of packet is sent to simulate ping requests (ICMP protocol).\r\n- Classes `IcmpPacket`, `HostPacket` and `VmPacket` now implement the new interface `NetworkPacket`\r\n- Re-designed event notification mechanisms that use the `EventListener` class to enable researchers to get notifications\r\n  about some events during simulation execution.

This work started several commits before. Previously the framework didn't create actual relationships among different classes, but stored Integer IDs as attributes to represent such relationships. This was a bad, confusing and very error prone design. \r\n\r\nSince such attributes were just an Integer (for instance the Cloudlet.vmId or Vm.brokerId), any possible integer value could be passed to such attributes, even an inexistent ID or the ID of an entity that wasn't from the expected class (the ID of a Datacenter could be set for the Cloudlet.vmId without compilation errors).\r\n\r\nNow CloudSim Plus just accepts IDs in very specific places and usually just internally. All the public interfaces that are used by researchers only accept actual objects such as Datacenters, Hosts, VMs or Cloudlets.\r\n\r\nThe framework was maintaining Lists and Maps of several objects that stored just the IDs of such objects, making it difficult to understand what were the actual objects that such Lists/Maps were referencing. With this release, instead of having a List<Integer> to store the IDs of a list of Hosts, the framework uses a List<Host>. The documentation was thoroughly updated for such attributes.\r\n\r\nNow that those attributes require an actual object instead of an ID, it is even easier to use and extend CloudSim Plus. \r\n\r\nSome of the benefits of this new design are presented below:\r\n\r\n- Several classes were refactored to stop working with IDs and starting providing a true object oriented framework.\r\n  Lots of attributes that were defined as a List of Integer or as a Map where the key was Integer, to store\r\n  the ID of entities, were changed to store the object itself not its ID.\r\n  It makes the framework far less error prone, since the Lists and Maps will just accept\r\n  the defined object.\r\n- It makes even clear to understand the framework code and to use it, since\r\n  that when a developer look at some of such Lists or Maps, he/she will immediately know\r\n  what such Lists/Maps are storing.\r\n- Storing actual objects instead of their IDs also improves the framework performance\r\n  since it doesn't have to get the object ID and look for the actual object inside\r\n  another List that in fact stored the objects (as it was common to be done).\r\n- Message passing mechanisms were also improved, storing actual objects into the SimEvent.data attribute\r\n  instead of the object ID. The source and destionation of a message sent is also performed internally\r\n  using just the ID, because changing these behaviour would require far more work.\r\n- The documentation of such Lists/Maps was reviewed and updated.\r\n- Network related classes were those ones that received lots of changes, mainly NetworkPacket implementing classes.\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/tarball/v0.8-beta.9", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/zipball/v0.8-beta.9", "html_url": "https://github.com/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/releases/tag/v0.8-beta.9", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/releases/4949565", "dateCreated": "2016-12-17T23:00:33Z", "datePublished": "2016-12-18T00:15:25Z"}, {"tag_name": "v0.8-beta.8", "name": "v0.8-beta.8 - Dynamic creation of VMs and Cloudlets.

See the [DynamicCreationOfVmsAndCloudlets.java](cloudsim-plus-examples/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples/DynamicCreationOfVmsAndCloudlets.java) example for more details.\r\n- Enabled the complete navigation from Cloudlet up to the Datacenter. Now it is possible to call `cloudlet.getVm().getHost().getDatacenter()` and navigate between all the relationships that were introduced in CloudSim Plus for such classes. And it is totally safe to make such a call, even before starting the simulation, that you will not get a `NullPointerException`. In case you make such a call before the simulation starts, as any allocation of Cloudlet or VMs was made, you will get default objects that follow the Null - Included the example [/cloudsim-plus-examples/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples/ParallelSimulationsExample.java]\r\n  that shows how to use Java 8 Parallel Streams to execute mutiple simulations scenarios in parallel.\r\n  Object Design Pattern, namely `Vm.NULL` for `getVm()`, `Host.NULL` for `getHost()` and `Datacenter.NULL` for `getDatacenter()`.\r\n- Included examples that show how to [schedule the simulation termination at a given time](cloudsim-plus-examples/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples/TerminateSimulationAtGivenTime.java), how to terminate it [when a specific condition is met](cloudsim-plus-examples/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples/TerminateSimulationAtGivenCondition.java) and how to [schedule a simulation pause at an specific time, before the simulation has started, and collect partial results](cloudsim-plus-examples/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples/PauseSimulationAtGivenTime1.java) and [at a given time, after the simulation has started](cloudsim-plus-examples/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples/PauseSimulationAtGivenTime2.java).\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- Changed requirement of cloudsim-plus-examples to Java 8 in order to start providing more advanced examples using Java 8 Lambda Expressions and Streams API.\r\n  Existing examples were not changed and run as before in Java 7.\r\n- Renamed method in Simulation interface: `pause(int src, double delay)` to `Simulation.pauseEntity(int src, double delay)`;\r\n  `hold(int src, long delay)` to `holdEntity(int src, long delay)` and `running()` to `isRunning()`.\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n- Removed the `numUsers` parameter, that represents the number of created DatacenterBrokers, from CloudSim constructor. Now when a Broker is created, it automatically \r\n  increases the `numberOfUsers` attribute in the given CloudSim instance. This automatically makes possible to create brokers dynamically (during simulation execution) without worring about such an attribute. Usually, dynamic creation of brokers was performed to allow dynamic submission of VMs and Cloudlets during simulation execution. However, as currently the `submitVmList` and `submitCloudletList` methods in DatacenterBroker implementations in CloudSim Plus allow submission of Cloudlets and VMs even after the simulation has started, it is not a requirement anymore to create a new broker just to perform such tasks. \r\n- Removed the `Simulation.stop()` method because it in fact was doing nothing. When the Simulation.start() is called, it already waits for the simulation to\r\n  finish executing and automatically stops when there is not more events to process.\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/tarball/v0.8-beta.8", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/zipball/v0.8-beta.8", "html_url": "https://github.com/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/releases/tag/v0.8-beta.8", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/releases/4891970", "dateCreated": "2016-12-12T09:11:26Z", "datePublished": "2016-12-12T09:15:14Z"}], "confidence": [1.0], "technique": "metadata"}}}
