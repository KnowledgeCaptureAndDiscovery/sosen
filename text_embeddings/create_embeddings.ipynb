      "obj:SoftwareVersion/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/v5.0.0\tembedding_sentence\tIt has description ## 1. Important new Features\\r\\n\\r\\n### 1.1. Implement synchronous simulations (#205)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis feature enables the simulation to be run inside a regular loop as below:\\r\\n\\r\\n```java\\r\\nsimulation.startSync();\\r\\nwhile(simulation.isRunning()){\\r\\n    simulation.runFor(INTERVAL);\\r\\n    /*\\r\\n    Perform some operation here, \\r\\n    such as data collection or submission of new VMs or Cloudlets. \\r\\n    */\\r\\n}\\r\\nsimulation.finish();\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThat makes it easier to interact with the simulation and perform some tasks, such as data collection.\\r\\nThanks for Pawel Koperek.\\r\\n\\r\\n### 1.2. DatacenterBroker\\r\\n\\r\\n- Enables Broker to try selecting the closest Datacenter to place VMs, according to their time zone (#212).\\r\\n- Enables Broker to destroy a VM and return the list of unfinished Cloudlets (#209). Thanks for Pawel Koperek.\\r\\n- Enables placing groups of VMs into the same PM (#90).\\r\\n- Introduces `DatacenterBrokerBestFit`. Thanks to Humaira Abdul Salam.\\r\\n- Introduces `DatacenterBrokerFirstFit`.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 2. Introduces new `Vm` methods and updates `Host`\\r\\n    \\r\\n- The `Vm.getHostCpuUtilization()` method enables computing the relative VM CPU utilization from the `Host`. That is different from the same method in `VmUtilizationHistory` since the former just works during simulation execution, while the latter uses the history to compute the utilization.\\r\\n- `Vm.getHostRamUtilization()` and `Vm.getHostBwUtilization()` provide the same feature for RAM and BW.\\r\\n- Adds the `VmRelativeHostResourceUtilizationExample` to show the relative percentage of each resource every VM is using from its Host.\\r\\n- Introduces `getUpTimeHours()` and `getTotalUpTimeHours()` methods in `Host` interface to return the number of hours a Host has been active.\\r\\n\\r\\nRenames following methods in `Host` and `Vm` to provide uniformity:\\r\\n\\r\\n- `Host.getUtilizationOfCpu` to `getCpuPercentUtilization`\\r\\n- `Host.getUtilizationOfCpuMips` to `getCpuMipsUtilization`\\r\\n- `Host.getUtilizationOfBw` to `getBwUtilization`\\r\\n- `Host.getUtilizationOfRam` to `getRamUtilization`\\r\\n- `Vm.getCpuPercentUsage` to `getCpuPercentUtilization`\\r\\n- `Vm.getTotalCpuMipsUsage` to `getTotalCpuMipsUtilization`\\r\\n\\r\\n## 3. Refactor and redesign classes in distributions package (#201)\\r\\n    \\r\\n- Provides uniformity for parameter order in `ContinuousDistribution` classes\\r\\n- Introduces new constructors for `ContinuousDistribution` classes, enabling the researcher to provide a specific `RandomGenerator` instance that will be used as the actual pseudo random number generator.\\r\\n- Makes the `ContinuousDistribution` classes to use inheritance instead of composition. Despite the recommendation is to favor composition, in this case, that was just causing a huge increase in memory usage in large scale simulations. This way, now `ContinuousDistribution` classes extend `AbstractRealDistribution` instead of storing an attribute of this type.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 4. General Features \\r\\n\\r\\n- Moves time-related methods from Conversion to TimeUtil class.\\r\\n- Introduces `VmAllocationPolicyWorstFit`, `VmAllocationPolicyRandom`, `VmAllocationPolicyRoundRobin`.\\r\\n- Moves `ExperimentRunner` and `Experiment` classes to main module, to enable researchers extend such classes to implement their own experiments that execute in a repeatable manner. This way, they can use a scientific approach to collect valid results. Moving this base classes to the main module stops researchers from depending on the `cloudsim-plus-testbeds` module, which just provides existing testbeds that may be used just as a learning resource.\\r\\n- Smaller bug-fixes.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 5. Performance \\r\\n\\r\\nThe performance improvements in this release are impressive. The list below shows where the improvements were made. If you want a glympse of the impact in simulation time, check the end of the [Exclusive Features section](https://github.com/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus#main-exclusive-features) at the home page.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Improves performance of Broker's Cloudlets creation request (#203)\\r\\n- The `Host` previous utilization mips is just used when there is a `DatacenterPowerSupply` instance attached to the `Datacenter`. Since getting the utilization of CPU is a very expensive operation in large scale experiments, if a Datacenter power supply is not set, the value is not stored.\\r\\n- Improves performance of idle VM detection (#200).\\r\\n- Improves overall performance of VmAllocationPolicies (#190, #191).\\r\\n- Improves `DatacenterBroker` performance for allocation of VMs and Cloudlets (#109, #188).\\r\\n- Improves `DatacenterBroker` performance for checking if a VM is alive (#187).\\r\\n\\r\\n### 5.1 `UtilizationModelStochastic`\\r\\n\\r\\n- Improves performance when getting the utilization value from the history map (#194).\\r\\n- Introduces `historyEnabled` attribute and `setHistoryEnabled()` to allow enabling or disabling the history of utilization values (#197).\\r\\n- Enables the utilization history by default, because that option brings more performance (at the cost of higher memory consumption). If you are running a large scale simulation, that history may grow too much, which will impact performance anyway. But for regular simulations, enabling the history provides better performance because a lower number of pseudo-random numbers will be generated.\\r\\n- Enables the `UtilizationModelStochastic` to always return a new utilization\\r\\n    * Allow the researcher to decide if a `UtilizationModelStochastic` instance will always return a new utilization value every time the `getUtilization()` methods are called.\\r\\n    * Returning a new random utilization value for every call to those methods enables the researcher to use a single `UtilizationModelStochastic` instance for all Cloudlets. This drastically reduces simulation time and memory consumption in large scale simulations. It also ensures that distinct Cloudlets may have different resource utilization even for the same requested time..\r\n",
      "obj:SoftwareVersion/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/v4.3.1\tembedding_sentence\tIt has description - #185 :: Warn when a simulation which has an explicit termination time is lasting too long. This way, the researcher may know if he/she has set a too long termination time, instead of just keep waiting the simulation to finish when there are no events to process.\\r\\n- #184 :: Refactor ContinuousDistribution implementations providing consistent order in construtor parameters. The parameter order of NormalDistr's constructor was changed from `NormalDistr(long seed, double mean, double standardDeviation)` to `NormalDistr(double mean, double standardDeviation, long seed)`. This way, the `SEED` (when available) is always the last parameter, conforming to constructors of other random number generators such as the UniformDistr.

To enable collecting such data, it's is required to set a `PowerModel` object by calling `host.getPowerSupply().setPowerModel(powerModel)`. The only difference from previous versions is that the `PowerModel` is defined inside the `PowerSupply` instead of the `Host`.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis way, if you don't need power-aware simulations, you need to do nothing because that is the default behaviour.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some examples such as the [PowerExample](https://github.com/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/blob/master/cloudsim-plus-examples/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples/PowerExample.java) and the [MigrationExample2_PowerUsage](https://github.com/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/blob/master/cloudsim-plus-examples/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples/migration/MigrationExample2_PowerUsage.java).\\r\\n\\r\\nMore details are presented below.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## VmUtilizationHistory\\r\\n\\r\\nAdds the `VmUtilizationHistory` class to store resource utilization history by a given `Vm`.

This way, the user have to manually enable the history to start collecting utilization data. It was disabled by default to reduce memory usage.\\r\\n\\r\\n## PowerSupply\\r\\n\\r\\nAdds the `PowerSupply` interface to concentrate all power consumption data and operations, enabling any `Host` to get such an information. The `PowerSupply` includes the `PowerModel` that was previously inside the `PowerHost` class.\\r\\n\\r\\n## PowerHost\\r\\n\\r\\n`PowerHost` class removed and its methods merged into Host.

Some of these principles, practices and recommendations are [Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern), [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29) and clean code programming.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith all these principles in mind, CloudSim Plus has become a modern, better structured and much easier-to-use  cloud simulation framework. It is a Java 8 framework that strongly relies on the most recent features of Java language to provide a code that is simpler, easier to understand and to extend. There are innumerous changes and several exclusive features and improvements that make CloudSim Plus a promising project.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the most relevant and exclusive features and improvements are presented below:\\r\\n- Parallel execution of experiments, enabling multiple runs of a given simulation to be executed simultaneously \\r\\n  in a multi-core machine.\\r\\n- Horizontal VM scaling to balance workload of dynamically arrived cloudlets by creating new VMs on-demand.\\r\\n- Dynamic creation of VMs and Cloudlets by delaying their submission to a broker.\\r\\n- Dynamic creation of VMs at runtime without requiring the need to create new brokers.\\r\\n- Listener objects to monitor several events happening during simulation execution, enabling metrics collection and dynamic resource allocation for SLA fulfillment.\\r\\n- Classes and interfaces to allow implementation of heuristics such as Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing, Ant Colony Systems and so on.\\r\\n- Implementation of the Completely Fair Scheduler used in recent version of the Linux Kernel, that in fact performs task preemption \\r\\n  as a multi-task mechanism.\\r\\n- Completely re-designed, reusable and simpler Network module that just works.\\r\\n- Extremely simpler constructors for objects such as Datacenter, Host, Vm, Cloudlet, VmAllocationPolicy, VmScheduler and ClodletSchedler.\\r\\n- A very easier way to initialize a simulation by just calling a no-args constructor of the CloudSim class.\\r\\n- Totally re-organized package and modules structure, grouping classes such as Hosts into an exclusive package.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd for the first time, a cloud simulation framework is provided at the [Maven Central repository](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.cloudsimplus/cloudsim-plus) to enable a researcher to include CloudSim Plus as a dependency into his/her pom.xml project file, making it even easier to use CloudSim Plus. Such a feature also enables researchers to implement new modules and tools running on top of CloudSim Plus, without requiring them to include CloudSim Plus source code inside their projects. That also encourage these researchers making changes to CloudSim Plus code to submit pull request to include those changes in the official repository, contributing to the entire academic and open source community. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe efforts of CloudSim Plus already were recognized by the acceptance of a paper in a top conference. More details will be provided as soon as the paper is published. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe'd like to hear from researchers using CloudSim Plus. Join us at the [Google Groups Forum.](https://groups.google.com/group/cloudsim-plus)\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more information, check the [README file at the project's home page](https://github.com/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus).\\r\\n.\r\n",
      "obj:SoftwareVersion/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/v0.9-beta.2\tembedding_sentence\tIt has description After that CloudSim Plus allowed the submission of VMs and Cloudlets to an already existing DatacenterBroker during simulation execution (see #43), now it provides an exclusive mechanism to perform horizontal scaling of VMs. Such a mechanism creates new VMs for a simulation with dynamic cloudlet arrival, according to a condition defined by the developer. That condition can check if the VM is overloaded based on CPU, BW or RAM usage.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt also provides a completely redesigned and refactored Network module that just works. The list of included features are as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n## Added\\r\\n- Introduced a `VmScaling` interface and a `HorizontalVmScalingSimple` class,\\r\\n  inside the [autoscaling package](https://github.com/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/tree/master/cloudsim-plus/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/autoscaling), that provides a horizontal scaling mechanism for VMs, allowing dynamic creation of VMs according to an overload condition. Such a condition is defined\\r\\n  by a predicate that can check different VM resources usage such as CPU, RAM or BW.\\r\\n  See the new [LoadBalancerByVmHorizontalScalingExample](https://github.com/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/tree/master/cloudsim-plus-examples/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples/LoadBalancerByVmHorizontalScalingExample.java) for a usage example.\\r\\n- Added the methods `addOnClockTickListener` and `removeOnClockTickListener` to `Simulation` interface to allow defining a Listener to be notified every time the simulation clock advances.\\r\\n- Added methods `addOnClockTickListener()` and `removeOnClockTickListener()` in Simulation interface in order to add\\r\\n  and remove listeners for the new OnClockTick event, that is fired every time that the simulation clock advances.\\r\\n- Added `Vm.getTotalUtilizationOfCpu()` to get Vm's CPU utilization percentage for the current simulation time.\\r\\n- Added `Broker.submitVm` and `Broker.submitCloudlet` to add a single Vm or Cloudlet to a broker.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Changed\\r\\n- Renamed the class `GraphReader` to `TopologyReader`.\\r\\n- Network module was almost totally refactored and redesigned to provide a module that just works.\\r\\n  The module was not reusasble at all and it had a huge amount of duplicated code. Some classes\\r\\n  such as Switch were just an entire copy from each other.\\r\\n  The packet classes relied on ID to identify the sender and receiver entities and it was\\r\\n  very difficult to know if a given packet class was storing the ID of a Host, Vm or Cloudlet.\\r\\n  Now the packets use actual objects such as Host, Vm and Cloudlet to make clear\\r\\n  what kind of entities are communicating.\\r\\n- The network examples were just confusing and useless. They have been completely refactored\\r\\n  and redesigned in order to provide a clear and understandable code that can in fact be reusable.\\r\\n.\r\n",
      "obj:SoftwareVersion/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/v0.9-beta.1\tembedding_sentence\tIt has description ### Added\\r\\n- Allowed to delay the submission of VMs by a `DatacenterBroker`, simulating the dynamic arrival of VMs (closes the feature request #23)\\r\\n- Included extremelly helpful package documentation that can be viewed directly on your IDE or online [here](http://cloudsimplus.org/apidocs/).\\r\\n  Such a package documentation gives a general overview of the classes used to build a cloud simulation.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Changed\\r\\n- Renamed `Simulation` class method `abruptallyTerminate` to `abort`.\\r\\n- Renamed the class `HostPacket` to `VmPacket` because such a kind of packet is sent between VMs.\\r\\n- Renamed the class `NetworkPacket` to `HostPacket` because such a kind of packet is sent between Hosts.\\r\\n- Renamed the class `InfoPacket` to `IcmpPacket` because such a kind of packet is sent to simulate ping requests (ICMP protocol).\\r\\n- Classes `IcmpPacket`, `HostPacket` and `VmPacket` now implement the new interface `NetworkPacket`\\r\\n- Re-designed event notification mechanisms that use the `EventListener` class to enable researchers to get notifications\\r\\n  about some events during simulation execution. The changes are described below:\\r\\n  - Classes renamed: `HostToVmEventInfo` to `VmHostEventInfo`, `DatacenterToVmEventInfo` to `VmDatacenterEventInfo`, \\r\\n    `VmToCloudletEventInfo` to `CloudletVmEventInfo`;\\r\\n  - Methods `Vm.setOnHostAllocationListener`, `Vm.setOnHostDeallocationListener`, `Vm.setOnVmCreationFailureListener`, `Vm.setOnUpdateVmProcessingListener`, `Cloudlet.setOnUpdateCloudletProcessingListener`, `Cloudlet.setOnCloudletFinishListener`,\\r\\n    `Simulation.setOnSimulationPausedListener`, `Simulation.setOnEventProcessingListener` and `Simulation.setOnEventProcessingListener`\\r\\n    were renamed, changing the prefix _set_ to _add_ because now it is possible to add multiple `EventListener`s to the same event \\r\\n    that you want to be notified about;\\r\\n  - Respective methods starting with the prefix _remove_ were added for each one of the methods presented above,\\r\\n    allowing to remove (unregister) an `EventListener` from the list.\\r\\n.\r\n",
      "obj:SoftwareVersion/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/v0.8-beta.9\tembedding_sentence\tIt has description This release introduces a huge amount of internal refactoring to provide a framework that really deals with actual Objects instead of Integer IDs. This work started several commits before. Previously the framework didn't create actual relationships among different classes, but stored Integer IDs as attributes to represent such relationships. This was a bad, confusing and very error prone design. \\r\\n\\r\\nSince such attributes were just an Integer (for instance the Cloudlet.vmId or Vm.brokerId), any possible integer value could be passed to such attributes, even an inexistent ID or the ID of an entity that wasn't from the expected class (the ID of a Datacenter could be set for the Cloudlet.vmId without compilation errors).\\r\\n\\r\\nNow CloudSim Plus just accepts IDs in very specific places and usually just internally. All the public interfaces that are used by researchers only accept actual objects such as Datacenters, Hosts, VMs or Cloudlets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe framework was maintaining Lists and Maps of several objects that stored just the IDs of such objects, making it difficult to understand what were the actual objects that such Lists/Maps were referencing. With this release, instead of having a List<Integer> to store the IDs of a list of Hosts, the framework uses a List<Host>. The documentation was thoroughly updated for such attributes.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that those attributes require an actual object instead of an ID, it is even easier to use and extend CloudSim Plus. \\r\\n\\r\\nSome of the benefits of this new design are presented below:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Several classes were refactored to stop working with IDs and starting providing a true object oriented framework.\\r\\n  Lots of attributes that were defined as a List of Integer or as a Map where the key was Integer, to store\\r\\n  the ID of entities, were changed to store the object itself not its ID.\\r\\n  It makes the framework far less error prone, since the Lists and Maps will just accept\\r\\n  the defined object.\\r\\n- It makes even clear to understand the framework code and to use it, since\\r\\n  that when a developer look at some of such Lists or Maps, he/she will immediately know\\r\\n  what such Lists/Maps are storing.\\r\\n- Storing actual objects instead of their IDs also improves the framework performance\\r\\n  since it doesn't have to get the object ID and look for the actual object inside\\r\\n  another List that in fact stored the objects (as it was common to be done).\\r\\n- Message passing mechanisms were also improved, storing actual objects into the SimEvent.data attribute\\r\\n  instead of the object ID. The source and destionation of a message sent is also performed internally\\r\\n  using just the ID, because changing these behaviour would require far more work.\\r\\n- The documentation of such Lists/Maps was reviewed and updated.\\r\\n- Network related classes were those ones that received lots of changes, mainly NetworkPacket implementing classes.\\r\\n.\r\n",
      "obj:SoftwareVersion/manoelcampos/cloudsim-plus/v0.8-beta.8\tembedding_sentence\tIt has description ### Added\\r\\n- Enabled dynamic creation of VMs and Cloudlets without requiring creation of Datacenter Brokers at runtime, enabling VMs to be created on-demand according to arrived cloudlets.\\r\\n  During simulation execution, new VMs and Cloudlets can be submitted using the methods `submitVmList` and `submitCloudletList` that they will be dynamically created. See the [DynamicCreationOfVmsAndCloudlets.java](cloudsim-plus-examples/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples/DynamicCreationOfVmsAndCloudlets.java) example for more details.\\r\\n- Enabled the complete navigation from Cloudlet up to the Datacenter. Now it is possible to call `cloudlet.getVm().getHost().getDatacenter()` and navigate between all the relationships that were introduced in CloudSim Plus for such classes. And it is totally safe to make such a call, even before starting the simulation, that you will not get a `NullPointerException`. In case you make such a call before the simulation starts, as any allocation of Cloudlet or VMs was made, you will get default objects that follow the Null - Included the example [/cloudsim-plus-examples/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples/ParallelSimulationsExample.java]\\r\\n  that shows how to use Java 8 Parallel Streams to execute mutiple simulations scenarios in parallel.\\r\\n  Object Design Pattern, namely `Vm.NULL` for `getVm()`, `Host.NULL` for `getHost()` and `Datacenter.NULL` for `getDatacenter()`.\\r\\n- Included examples that show how to [schedule the simulation termination at a given time](cloudsim-plus-examples/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples/TerminateSimulationAtGivenTime.java), how to terminate it [when a specific condition is met](cloudsim-plus-examples/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples/TerminateSimulationAtGivenCondition.java) and how to [schedule a simulation pause at an specific time, before the simulation has started, and collect partial results](cloudsim-plus-examples/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples/PauseSimulationAtGivenTime1.java) and [at a given time, after the simulation has started](cloudsim-plus-examples/src/main/java/org/cloudsimplus/examples/PauseSimulationAtGivenTime2.java).\\r\\n\\r\\n### Changed\\r\\n- Changed requirement of cloudsim-plus-examples to Java 8 in order to start providing more advanced examples using Java 8 Lambda Expressions and Streams API.\\r\\n  Existing examples were not changed and run as before in Java 7.\\r\\n- Renamed method in Simulation interface: `pause(int src, double delay)` to `Simulation.pauseEntity(int src, double delay)`;\\r\\n  `hold(int src, long delay)` to `holdEntity(int src, long delay)` and `running()` to `isRunning()`.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Removed\\r\\n- Removed the `numUsers` parameter, that represents the number of created DatacenterBrokers, from CloudSim constructor. Now when a Broker is created, it automatically \\r\\n  increases the `numberOfUsers` attribute in the given CloudSim instance. This automatically makes possible to create brokers dynamically (during simulation execution) without worring about such an attribute. Usually, dynamic creation of brokers was performed to allow dynamic submission of VMs and Cloudlets during simulation execution. However, as currently the `submitVmList` and `submitCloudletList` methods in DatacenterBroker implementations in CloudSim Plus allow submission of Cloudlets and VMs even after the simulation has started, it is not a requirement anymore to create a new broker just to perform such tasks. \\r\\n- Removed the `Simulation.stop()` method because it in fact was doing nothing. When the Simulation.start() is called, it already waits for the simulation to\\r\\n  finish executing and automatically stops when there is not more events to process.\\r\\n.\r\n",
